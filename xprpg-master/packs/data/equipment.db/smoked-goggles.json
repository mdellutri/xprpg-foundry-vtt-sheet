While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Avert Gaze]{Averting Your Gaze}, but all creatures have @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealment} from you.</p>\n<p>The fact that the goggles conceal creatures is part of what grants the wearer the item's benefits. If you have a way to negate the concealment from the smoked goggles, you no longer gain the benefit, either.</p>"
