If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves against area effects; and to Stealth checks to @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Hide]{Hide}, @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Sneak]{Sneak}, or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}, or end this effect as a free action.</p>"
