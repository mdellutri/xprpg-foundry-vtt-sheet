You can spend a single action (this action has the concentrate trait) to determine if any magical auras are present in the area. This has the effects of a 1st-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.xprpg.spells-srd.Detect Magic]{Detect Magic}</em> spell but isn't magical. By straining, you can also discover the source of the magic and its school (with the effect of a 4th-level <em>detect magic</em> spell), but doing so prevents you from using this ability again until you've rested for 8 hours.</p>"
