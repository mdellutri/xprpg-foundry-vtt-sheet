You command your mount to Stride up to its Speed (or to @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Burrow]{Burrow}, @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Climb]{Climb}, @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Fly]{Fly}, or @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Swim]{Swim}, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your mount.</p>\n<p>Your mount deals damage equal to the melee Strike using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mount's Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.conditionitems.Flat-Footed]{Flat-Footed} until the end of your next turn. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement.</p>"
