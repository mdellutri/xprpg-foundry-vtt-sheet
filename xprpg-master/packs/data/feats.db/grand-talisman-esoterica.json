Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Affix a Talisman]{Affix a Talisman}, you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item with this ability.</p>"
