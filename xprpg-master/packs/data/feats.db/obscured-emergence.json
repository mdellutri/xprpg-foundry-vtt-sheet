When you stop being @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} due to your own actions (not due to someone successfully finding you), you gain @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealement} until the start of your next turn as people's eyes find it oddly hard to focus on you. As usual for concealment involving an obvious visual manifestation, you can't use this concealment to @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.actionsxprpg.Hide]{Hide}.</p>"
