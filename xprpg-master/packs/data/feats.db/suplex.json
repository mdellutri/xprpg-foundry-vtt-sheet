Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained; on a success, the target lands @UUID[Compendium.xprpg.conditionitems.Prone]{Prone}, and on a critical success, the target lands prone and takes an additional [[/r 2d6[bludgeoning]]] damage. Regardless of whether the Strike is successful, you immediately release your hold on the target.</p>"
